/*
 * class reduction_features
 * Description:
 *   This data structure manages access and lifetime of the features data used in various VW reductions.
 *
 *   All contained data types MUST instantiate a `clear()` function that readies the object for reuse.
 *
 *   Calling create() on an existing element will clear and overwrite the existing data
 *
 * Member functions:
 *   T& get<T>();
 *   const T& get<T>() const;
 *   void clear();
 *
 * Data structure usage:
 *   Accessing an instance of existing data:
 *     features_data fd;
 *     auto& data = fd.get<data_type>();
